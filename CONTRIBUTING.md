# Contributing to NeverWrite

Thanks for your interest in contributing to NeverWrite. This guide covers everything you need to get started.

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Notes |
| ------ | --------- | ------- |
| **Node.js** | 22+ | Required for desktop app and CI |
| **npm** | 11+ | Package manager for `apps/desktop` |
| **pnpm** | 10.33+ | Package manager for `apps/web-clipper` |
| **Rust** | 1.96.0 | Pinned by `rust-toolchain.toml`; Edition 2021 across all crates |

### Platform-specific

- **macOS**: Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`)
- **Windows**: MSVC Build Tools, WebView2
- **Linux**: Standard build essentials for Rust and Electron packaging (`build-essential`, `pkg-config`, `curl`, `wget`)

```

## Getting started

### Desktop app

```bash
cd apps/desktop
npm install

# Frontend only (Vite dev server)
npm run renderer:dev

# Full Electron app with Rust sidecar
npm run dev
```

### Web clipper

```bash
cd apps/web-clipper
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

### Rust workspace

```bash
# From the repo root
cargo build
cargo test
```

## Development workflow

### 1. Fork and clone

```bash
git clone <your-fork-url>
cd <your-clone-directory>
```

### 2. Create a branch

```bash
git checkout -b my-change
```

### 3. Make your changes

Follow the code style guidelines below, then verify:

```bash
# Desktop
cd apps/desktop
npm run lint          # ESLint
npm run build         # TypeScript check (tsc -b) + Vite build
npm test              # Vitest

# Web clipper
cd apps/web-clipper
pnpm run check        # TypeScript + tests + build (all-in-one)

# Rust
cargo test
```

### 4. Commit and push

```bash
git add <files>
git commit -m "fix(editor): resolve cursor jump on live preview toggle"
git push origin my-change
```

### 5. Open a pull request

Open a PR against `main`. Describe what changed and why. Link related issues if applicable.

## Commit messages

We use a lightweight conventional format:

```text
type(scope): short description
```

**Types**: `fix`, `feat`, `refactor`, `chore`, `docs`, `test`, `perf`

**Scope** is optional but encouraged for targeted changes (e.g., `editor`, `vault`, `clipper`, `ai`).

**Examples**:

```text
fix(editor): resolve cursor jump on live preview toggle
feat(clipper): add selection-only clipping mode
refactor: simplify change rail review projection
chore: clean up pdf tab view zoom handling
```

Keep messages descriptive and action-focused. Write in lowercase unless starting with a proper noun.

## Code style

### TypeScript

- **Strict mode** is enabled (`strict: true`, `noUnusedLocals`, `noUnusedParameters`)
- Use `import type` for type-only imports (`verbatimModuleSyntax` is enforced)
- Prefix unused parameters with `_`
- ESLint with TypeScript strict rules — run `npm run lint` before committing

### React

- Functional components only
- Zustand for state management — stores live in `app/store/`
- Feature code goes in `features/<feature-name>/`
- Shared components go in `components/`

### Rust

- Default `rustfmt` formatting
- Edition 2021
- Use `cargo clippy` for additional lint checks

### General principles

- **Simplicity first** — the simplest solution that works
- **Fix root causes** — don't patch around broken abstractions
- **Bounded refactors** — if a fix requires restructuring, keep it scoped to the affected module
- **No speculative cleanup** — don't refactor code that your change doesn't touch

## Testing

### Frontend (Vitest + Testing Library)

```bash
# Desktop
cd apps/desktop
npm test              # Run once
npm run test:watch    # Watch mode

# Web clipper
cd apps/web-clipper
pnpm test             # Watch mode
pnpm test:run         # Run once
```

- Test files live next to the code they test: `MyComponent.test.tsx`
- Use `describe()`, `it()`, `expect()` from Vitest
- Use Testing Library for component tests (`@testing-library/react`)
- Mock desktop runtime APIs through `@neverwrite/runtime` helpers and `vi.mocked()`

### Rust (cargo)

```bash
cargo test                          # All workspace tests
cargo test -p neverwrite-vault      # Single crate
```

## Architecture notes

### Frontend stack

- **React 19** + **TypeScript** + **Vite**
- **Tailwind CSS 4** — utility-first styling with CSS variables for theming
- **CodeMirror 6** — markdown editor with custom extensions (live preview, change tracking)
- **Zustand** — lightweight state management with per-feature stores

### Backend

- **Electron** — desktop shell and IPC bridge
- **Tokio** — async runtime
- **notify** — filesystem watching
- **Node HTTP server** — local desktop API for web clipper communication (`127.0.0.1:32145`)

### Key patterns

- **Feature modules**: each feature in `features/` owns its components, hooks, and store slices
- **ActionLog**: patch-based change tracking with author attribution (user vs AI)
- **Live preview**: CodeMirror ViewPlugin that hides markdown syntax when the cursor is elsewhere
- **Wikilinks**: parsed from markdown, resolved against the vault index for navigation and backlinks

## Environment variables

For development, these optional variables can override default runtime paths:

| Variable | Purpose |
| ---------- | --------- |
| `NEVERWRITE_CODEX_ACP_BIN` | Override Codex ACP runtime binary |
| `NEVERWRITE_CLAUDE_ACP_BIN` | Override Claude ACP runtime binary |
| `NEVERWRITE_KILO_ACP_BIN` | Override Kilo ACP runtime binary |
| `NEVERWRITE_WEB_CLIPPER_DEV_ORIGINS` | Allow unpacked extension origins |

## Versioning

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). During the `0.x` phase, minor bumps may include breaking changes.

Versions are kept in sync across:

- `apps/desktop/package.json`
- `apps/desktop/package-lock.json`
- `apps/desktop/native-backend/Cargo.toml`
- `apps/web-clipper/package.json`
- `CHANGELOG.md`

Use `scripts/bump-version.sh` to update the package, native backend, and Web
Clipper version files at once, then add the matching `CHANGELOG.md` release entry.
Before creating a release tag, run:

```bash
node scripts/validate-release-metadata.mjs --tag vX.Y.Z
```

## Release automation

Desktop releases are maintainer-driven and run through the Electron release workflow in GitHub Actions.
The same workflow validates and attaches the Web Clipper Chrome and Firefox MV3 zip artifacts to the GitHub Release.

Before triggering [`.github/workflows/release-desktop.yml`](.github/workflows/release-desktop.yml):

- Bump the desktop version sources with `scripts/bump-version.sh X.Y.Z`
- Add or update the matching `CHANGELOG.md` entry
- Run `node scripts/validate-release-metadata.mjs --tag vX.Y.Z`
- Create and push the release tag, for example `v0.2.1`
- Ensure the required signing secrets are configured in the GitHub repository settings
- Review the Electron release topology and signing requirements documented in [`release/appcast/README.md`](release/appcast/README.md)

## Reporting issues

- Search the existing issue tracker before opening a new one
- Include steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and actual behavior
- For crashes, include the OS version and any relevant logs
