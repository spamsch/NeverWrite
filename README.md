[Important note about Claude subscription usage in NeverWrite starting June 15, 2026](https://github.com/jsgrrchg/NeverWrite/discussions/83)
  - Update: Claude delayed their decision, you can continue to use claude native integration inside NeverWrite. More info in the linked discussion.

**Gemini ACP support has been removed from NeverWrite.** Google redirected Gemini CLI subscription usage toward Antigravity, which is closed source and does not expose ACP support for third-party apps. You can still use Antigravity manually from a terminal, but NeverWrite no longer registers a Gemini ACP runtime. If you have a Gemini API key, you can still use Gemini models through Kilo or OpenCode.
For more information, please read this discussion: [https://github.com/jsgrrchg/NeverWrite/discussions/241]

----

NeverWrite is a local-first knowledge workspace for people who need to handle workflows with multiple parallel agents and subagents. Built like a code editor, but for markdown. It has inline review changes, like Cursor and others. Please help me test it!

Today the repository combines:

- An Electron desktop app with a Rust sidecar that opens a local vault and keeps working state on disk.
- A Markdown, CSV, and text/code editing workflow with wikilinks, live preview, frontmatter editing, spellcheck, and grammar checking.
- Knowledge navigation tools such as backlinks, tags, advanced search, bookmarks, concept maps, and a 2D/3D graph view.
- An ACP-based AI layer with Codex, Claude, Grok, Kilo, and OpenCode runtimes.
- An explicit AI change-review system with inline review inside the editor and a dedicated surface in chat and a tab with changes pending approval.
- A separate browser web clipper that can save directly into the desktop app through a local API, with deep-link fallback. Compatible with both Firefox and Chromium.

## What NeverWrite Is Today

The current product already includes:

- Local vault opening with progress reporting, persisted snapshots, filesystem watching, and incremental re-sync
- A desktop workspace with tabs, sidebars, command palette, quick switcher, detached windows, and first-class terminal tabs
- Native-feeling editing for Markdown notes, CSV files, PDFs, images, HTML previews, and generic text/code files
- Embedded Excalidraw-based concept maps stored as `.excalidraw` files in the vault. The map format is visible and editable by agents.
- A graph view with global, local, and overview modes plus 2D and 3D rendering
- AI chat sessions with attachments from the vault, slash commands, transcript persistence, and runtime-specific capabilities
- A real AI review pipeline so generated edits are not silently committed

Saved AI conversations are stored locally under each vault's hidden `.neverwrite/sessions/` directory.
See [AI session history and crash recovery](docs/ai-session-history.md) for the disk layout and recovery flow.
NeverWrite also writes local diagnostic logs under the app data `logs/` directory; see [App logs](docs/app-logs.md) for platform-specific paths and privacy notes.

## Why It Is Different

- AI edits stay reviewable through an accumulated action log, inline controls, and a dedicated review tab. It is much more than a chat.
- The desktop app is not limited to Markdown notes; it already handles CSV files, PDFs, images, text/code files, and maps in the same workspace.
- It features a best-in-class multipane experience that lets the user parallelize multiple lines of work with agents while simultaneously reading and editing documents in the same window.
- The web clipper allows saving web articles quickly, securely, and efficiently.

## Stack

- **Desktop shell**: Electron 41, React 19, TypeScript 6, Vite 8, Tailwind CSS 4, CodeMirror 6, Excalidraw, PDF.js, electron-updater
- **Desktop native backend**: Rust 2021, Tokio, `notify`, `portable-pty`, `reqwest`, `spellbook`, app-owned spellcheck runtime
- **Desktop main process**: Electron IPC plus a Node HTTP server for the local web clipper API
- **Shared Rust crates**: vault parsing, indexing, search, diff, DTOs
- **Browser extension**: WXT, React, TypeScript, Chrome MV3 and Firefox MV3 targets

## Development

**Important**: there is no top-level JavaScript workspace package. JavaScript dependencies are installed per app.

### Requirements

- Rust and Cargo
- Node.js 22.12.0+ and npm for `apps/desktop`
- Node.js 22+ and pnpm for `apps/web-clipper` (`packageManager` is pinned to `pnpm@10.33.0`)

CI and release workflows are pinned to Node.js 22. Use Node 22.12.0 or newer for desktop work so Electron's install tooling matches the declared engine.

### Desktop app

```bash
cd apps/desktop
npm install
npm run dev
```

That starts the Electron desktop app plus the local renderer dev server.

If you only need the renderer dev server:

```bash
cd apps/desktop
npm run renderer:dev
```

### Web clipper

```bash
cd apps/web-clipper
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Build unpacked extension artifacts:

```bash
cd apps/web-clipper
pnpm build
```

This produces:

- `apps/web-clipper/dist/chrome-mv3/`
- `apps/web-clipper/dist/firefox-mv3/`

### Rust workspace

```bash
cargo test
```

## Validation

Desktop frontend tests:

```bash
cd apps/desktop
npm test
```

Web clipper validation:

```bash
cd apps/web-clipper
pnpm check
```

Rust workspace tests:

```bash
cargo test
```

The repository already contains broad Vitest coverage in the desktop app and web clipper, plus Rust integration tests for vault and index behavior.

## AI Runtime Notes

NeverWrite currently wires five ACP runtimes:

- `codex-acp`
- `claude-acp`
- `grok-acp`
- `kilo-acp`
- `opencode-acp`

Current packaging status:

- Codex is intended to be bundled as a sidecar binary in desktop release builds.
- Claude is intended to be bundled through an embedded Node runtime plus vendored runtime files.
- Grok is integrated in the app, but not bundled by default today.
- Kilo is integrated in the app, but not bundled by default today.
- OpenCode is integrated in the app, but not bundled by default today.

Useful runtime overrides during development:

- `NEVERWRITE_CODEX_ACP_BIN`
- `NEVERWRITE_CLAUDE_ACP_BIN`
- `NEVERWRITE_GROK_ACP_BIN`
- `NEVERWRITE_KILO_ACP_BIN`
- `NEVERWRITE_OPENCODE_ACP_BIN`

For release builds, see `apps/desktop/scripts/stage-electron-sidecar.mjs` and `release/appcast/README.md`.

## Web Clipper Notes

The web clipper talks to the desktop app through a local HTTP API on port `32145`.

When developing against an unpacked extension build, the desktop app blocks arbitrary extension origins by default. To explicitly allow a local extension origin, start the desktop app with:

```bash
cd apps/desktop
NEVERWRITE_WEB_CLIPPER_DEV_ORIGINS="chrome-extension://<dev-id>,moz-extension://<dev-id>" npm run dev
```

Use exact origins only. Wildcards are intentionally unsupported.

## Project Status

NeverWrite is in a polish and hardening phase. Core systems already exist, but the project is still pre-`1.0`, in the process of resolving edge cases — help me find them!!

The areas with the highest product sensitivity right now are:

- AI review and change control
- Inline review and merge behavior
- Session persistence and multi-window workflows
- Desktop-to-clipper integration
- Using the 3D graph on large vaults has memory leaks; after using it, prefer restarting the application.
